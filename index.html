<h2>‘Kalki 2898 AD’ screening halted at Hyderabad PVR after water leak;
videos of agitated moviegoers emerge</h2>
<img src="k.avif" alt="">
<p>Kalki (Sanskrit: कल्कि), also called Kalkin,[1] is the prophesied tenth and final 
incarnation of the god Vishnu. He is described to appear in order to end the Kali Yuga,
one of the four periods in the endless cycle of existence (Krita) in Vaishnava cosmology.
The end of the Kali Yuga states this will usher in the new epoch of Satya Yuga in the 
cycle of existence, until the Mahapralaya (dissolution of the universe).[1][2]
Kalki is described in the Puranas as the avatar who rejuvenates existence by ending the
darkest and destructive period to remove adharma (unrighteousness) and ushering in the
Satya Yuga, while riding a white horse with a fiery sword.[2] The description and details
of Kalki are different among various Puranas. Kalki is also found in Buddhist texts, for
example the Kalachakra-Tantra of Tibetan Buddhism.</p>
